**Brief Description of Project**
This project is an 80's movie trivia game that consists of 6 catagories: Action, Horror, Cult, Chevy Chase, Scifi, and Movie Magic. This project demonstrates the authors current abilities with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML elements.

**Problem Domain**
The purposed purpose of this project is to create a website where users can answer trivia questions, track their score, and submit questions for other users. We identified that there was a need for a fun, creative, and free website. Our website solves the problems of; having something to do on a lunch break, showing off your prowess in 80s movie trivia, boredom while waiting for public tranportation/food/children to find their shoes, and most importantly a place to nerd out with other nerds by creating a nerd community online.
