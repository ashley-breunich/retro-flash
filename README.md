**Brief Description of Project**
This project is an 80's movie trivia game that consists of 6 catagories: Action, Horror, Cult, Chevy Chase, Scifi, and Movie Magic.

**Problem Domain**
- One problem that we had at first was that our vision was too big. So we had to dial it back.
- The next issue was that we had was that if we were going to movie trivia or other forms of culture in the 80's. We voted on the direction that we wanted to go.
-   
**Project Before and After**
- At the start we just had ideas and a wireframe. Then came narrowing down whether we wanted to do movie trivia or 80's culture throughout the entire 80's.
- We finally chose to do movie trivia.
- Which led to us coming up with the 6 catagories that we chose.
- Then the each of us took on writing each of the HTML pages.
- After those were established we started writing basic Javascript then when that functionality came together then we all started working on different taks.
- Which would allow us to get the different aspects of our game working instead of just waiting for each task to be completed. 
- We had to communicate with each other about who should do a PR first so we didn't run into merge conflicts.
- Once all of these tasks which took us through the week. We got together and discussed and also tried to come up with better ideas for some of the concepts or try to figure out how to fix an issue.
